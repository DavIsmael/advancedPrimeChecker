To generate .json files you're gonna need to add gson to your project structure. It is listed under the "dependencies directory" on this repo.

To access the project structure on Intellij IDEA:

1. CTRL + ALT + SHIFT + S or locate the file option on the top left corner and head to "Project Structure"
2. Select the "Modules" option
3. Click on Dependencies
4. Click on the "+" button and select "JARs or directories"
5. Find the Gson JAR, select it, click ok
6. Apply, click ok

(You can also find Gson through the Maven Repository, https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.google.code.gson/gson)

PS: This project is not perfect at all, beware.
